DSP Hackathon
========================================

Welcome to Ericsson Nikola Tesla's DSP Hackathon!

Created and organized by Ericsson Nikola Tesla's R&D center, the largest center of its kind in the region, this competition is intended to promote one of their fields of expertise â€“ digital signal processing. 

In this competition, you will get a chance to learn and show your knowledge on digital signal processing through a series of tasks. The competition is organized having three levels of difficulties. Through each level, you expand your knowledge and progress to the goal of understanding how modern communication systems use digital domain to facilitate radio connectivity.

The competition is open to Croatian citizens. We highly encourage students pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in electrical engineering or computing to enroll. Previous basic knowledge of signal processing is desirable, but not required.

As you solve different tasks, you will be able to post your solutions via GitHub. Only you and reviewers from Ericsson Nikola Tesla will be able to view your solutions. You will then receive a review, which will enable you to move on to the next level. The best performers will be rewarded and offered a job interview or internship at Ericsson Nikola Tesla.

**DSP Hackathon is open until June 14, 2021.**

We look forward to your participation!
