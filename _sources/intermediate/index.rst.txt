Intermediate Level
===================

Welcome to the Intermediate Level of DSP Hackathon. Here you will find the assignments and input files needed to solve them. Post your solutions here, in a format described in each of assignment's texts.

As described on our Propositions page, you must solve all the Basic Level assignments before any of your submissions to the Intermediate Level are reviewed. On the same page, you will find the criteria you must fulfill on the Intermediate Level to be allowed to continue on to the Advanced Level. Remember, you must solve at least 4 assignments in the Intermediate Level.

Read through assignment texts carefully to be sure about the submission format you must follow. Note that some assignments don't have to be fully completed for your solution to count towards leveling up to the Advanced Level. However, to win a prize, only full solutions are considered.
