   By clicking the button, you are enrolling into Ericsson Nikola Tesla's DSP Hackathon 2021.

   We would also like to use this opportunity to provide you with relevant information regarding the use of your personal data and its protection. More on this can be found in our :doc:`privacy`.
   
By entering the GitHub Classroom, your own git repository is created, and you can post your solutions there. By pushing your local changes to GitHub, a pull request is automatically created. In a single git push, you can post a solution to any number of given tasks.

At this point, our reviewers get a notification and start evaluating the solutions you posted. You will get feedback on the GitHub Classroom page.
