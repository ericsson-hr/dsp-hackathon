Basic Level
========================================

To start off with the DSP Hackathon, you will learn the basics of digital signal processing.
We've prepared a series of lectures that will provide you with the necessary baseline to proceed with more challenging tasks.

You will not be graded for solving this level. However, if you wish to submit a solution for the Intermediate level, you will be required to present your work on the Basic level as well.
The details on submitting your solution will be presented on the Intermediate level.

For now, sit back, take a notebook, and let's dive into the world of DSP theory.
